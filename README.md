A brief description of your project.

## Project Structure

This project consists of the following directories in the root folder:

- **client**: Contains the frontend of the application. This is where we'll develop and build the user interface.
- **server**: Contains the backend of the application, where the server-side logic runs. Typically, this will include a Node.js server using Express or similar technologies.
- **public**: This folder holds static assets that are publicly accessible, such as images and other files needed by the client.
